# Solidworks-Macros README

### Installation
In order to run this code you will need access to Solidworks and a coding environment in windows. I used 
[Solidworks 2019](https://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/downloads.htm),
[Anaconda for Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), and
[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).


An python wrapper called PyWin32 also needs to be installed. It allows you to gain access to the Win32 API and allows you to create and use COM objects. To install: 
```
conda install -c anaconda pywin32
```

### Start-Up

Your submission repository should have a file called README.md written in Markdown. This file should briefly summarize your project and explain how to use your code. By following the instructions in the README, anyone else should be able to run your project, provided they are also running Ubuntu 20.04.

If you installed any additional packages or libraries, you must mention them in the README. Ideally, you should also include installation instructions for these libraries, such as by using the conda or pip commands (which are often found in the documentation for other libraries).

Beyond these requirements, the structure and content of the README is up to you, but we expect that your README should be relatively easy to follow and understand.
